Hello! This is a project I created for my Intermediate Programming class in my winter term during my first year at South Hills School of Business and Technology. This project had me use C# to create a Blazor web app for a pizza ordering website. I incorporated Material's design library myself instead of the Bootstrap library that we covered in class. This project is an extension of my midterm project where I programmed a pizza ordering application that launched from Visual Studio's terminal. That first project was about learning how classes inherit from one another and work together.
